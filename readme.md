# Borgmanities

*Resistance is facile.*

This project is for fun and learning. We are currently working on a
twitter bot in Haskell (plus a touch of python), but may expand in any
number of directions in the future. If we had an agenda, it would
include opposing borgification.

## Active Project:

- [BotticelliBot](https://github.com/aBathologist/borgmanities/wiki/BotticelliBot): a nascent twitter bot.

## Todo:

Todo list has been moved into the [issue tracker](https://github.com/aBathologist/borgmanities/milestones/BotticelliBot%20Launch).
