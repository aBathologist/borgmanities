    We are humans. Publish your research and share of your soul.
    We will add your cultural and intellectual accomplishments to our own.
    Your insights will adapt to confirm our theses.
    Resistance is facile.

This project is for fun and learning. We are currently working on a twitter bot in Haskell, but may expand in any number of directions in the future. If we had an agenda, it would include opposing borgification.

## Active Project:

- [BotticelliBot](https://github.com/aBathologist/borgmanities/wiki/BotticelliBot): a nascent twitter bot.

## Todo:

Todo list has been moved into the [issue tracker](https://github.com/aBathologist/borgmanities/milestones/BotticelliBot%20Launch).
