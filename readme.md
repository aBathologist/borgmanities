# Borgmanities

    Resistance is facile.

This project was for fun and learning. We made a
twitter bot in Haskell (plus a touch of Python). 
If we had an agenda, it would have included opposing 
borgification.

You can read the nonsense it tweeted on its [Twitter timeline](https://twitter.com/BotticelliBot) 
or read documentation about it's development on the [BotticelliBot wiki](https://github.com/aBathologist/borgmanities/wiki/BotticelliBot).
