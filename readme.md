# Borgmanities

    We are two humans. Publish your works and share of your soul.
    Your cultural and intellectual accomplishments will be added to our own.
    Your insights will adapt to support our theses.
    Resistance is facile.

[Citation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyenRCJ_4Ww), however, will be meticulous.

This project is for fun and learning. We are currently working on a twitter bot in Haskell, but may expand in any number of directions in the future. If we had an agenda, it would include opposing borgification.

Active Project:

- [BotticelliBot](https://github.com/aBathologist/borgmanities/wiki/BotticelliBot): a nascent twitter bot.
